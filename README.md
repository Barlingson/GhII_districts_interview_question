# GhII_districts_interview_question
We were asked to solve 28 districts of malawi and make every district (Node) should get coonected to its neiboring districts(edges). I have used forced smulation algorithm to create force-directed layout using D3.js  tool

Instructions:
1. Open index.html in your browser to view and interact with the Malawi districts force-directed graph.
2. Drag nodes to reposition them. Hover to highlight connected districts.
3. Optimized node positions will be printed in the browser console after the layout stabilizes.

Dependencies:
- D3.js v7 or later (included via CDN in index.html)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
